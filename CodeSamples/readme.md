Sites that I have bug-fixed at my time at Verndale:

Karmaloop's Plndr site is a bit more challenging to demonstrate.  Please take a look at http://www.plndr.com on both mobile, tablet, and desktop to see responsive design.

As for Javascript at Plndr.com --
Note that neither of these files currently exist on the website, so there are no demos in the wild.
Responsive Banner controlled the size of a banner used on the front page, depending on the size of screen and version/type of browser.
Clothing Filter was supposed to filter between brand, size, and color.  All of these values were called by Ajax, but since I didn't work on that part of the file, I didn't include it. After each successful Ajax call, the filter script fired. Unfortunatly, it was never used because of the speed of the Ajax calls.
